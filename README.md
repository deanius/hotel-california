## Usage

`npm start`

## Structure

The project runs a node server (`/server.js`) on port 8470,
and a webpack server on port 3120 concurrently (aka in "parallel" mode).
API requests `/api/rooms` and `/api/occupancy` are served up by the code in `/server.js`.

Other than that, it's basic Create React App.

## Giving Back
